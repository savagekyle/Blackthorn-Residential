              to find someone who fulfills promises to your expectations. We
              found that someone in Rob Savage. He provided a rendering of the

          <h1>About Rob</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            A graduate of Miami University (OH), Rob worked alongside his
            builder brother and Master Craftsman father in a home renovation
            business during his early years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following College, Rob spent many years working for a publicly
            traded top 100 builder in the nation. Learning from this proven
            leader established Robâ€™s understanding of new construction and the
            critical need to schedule each project from start to completion.
            After hundreds of homes built, as well as opening a new market for
            this company in Knoxville, Rob decided to stay in Knoxville and
            raise his family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rob and his father continued to build and remodel new homes for many
            years in the Knoxville and Tellico Village markets. After many years
            of success, and the retirement of his father, Rob went to work for
            one of the premier builders in the market, working with and for the
            most decerning customers, designers, and architects in the Knoxville
            market. After many years of putting his talents to work for others,
            Rob knew it was time to put his vast knowledge to work for himself
            and his family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Blackthorn Residential and Rob Savage have put their
            attention to detail and quality construction to work creating
            amazing additions and customer renovations for many in the Knoxville
            Market.
